# Lyric-based Music Recommendation System
## Project Title: J.O.H.A.N.N (joËˆhan)
**Jukebox Orchestrator: a Harmonic Analytics, Navigational Nexus**

## Overview

The Lyric-based Music Recommendation System is a project aimed at providing personalized music recommendations by analyzing the sentiment of song lyrics. The system utilizes the Spotify API to gather a user's saved songs, web-crawls Genius.com to extract lyrics, and employs GPT sentiment analysis to suggest similar songs with matching emotional tones.

## Background

Try asking your friends whether they listen to the lyrics or instrumental (beat included) part of a song more. Less often you find people who focus on just the lyrics of a song.

I am one of those people.

With the abundance of music available on streaming platforms like Spotify, users often face the challenge of discovering new songs that align with their lyrical preferences. All the data gathered on songs tends to fall around what the song sounds like, leaving us lyrics searchers in the dark and left out of recommendation algorithms.\
This project addresses the issue by combining data from the Spotify API, Genius.com, and ChatGPT to create a sentiment-driven music recommendation system.
